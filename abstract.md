# Abstract

Celem niniejszej pracy jest stworzenie systemu zbierającego dane z rozproszonych czujników z wykorzystaniem technologii LoRa (Long Range) oraz ich zapisywanie w bazie danych w celu dalszego przetworzenia.
W ramach pracy został stworzony system zbierający dane z różnych czujników, takich jak termometry czy higrometry.
Informacje są zbierane przez autorskie punkty dostępowe LoRa, które następnie przekazują je do serwera.
Serwer przechowuje dane w bazie danych InfluxDB 2, która jest często wybierana do zastosowań IoT (Internet of Things).
W pracy: 
* zostały opisane technologie, protokoły i urządzenia wykorzystane w projekcie;
* przedstawiono istniejące rozwiązania, zarówno przemysłowych jak i naukowych; zostały one również porównane z rozwiązaniem zaproponowanym w ramach pracy;
* opisano założenia projektowe oraz szczegółowa implementacja systemu;
* został opisany proces wdrożenia systemu oraz przeprowadzone testy; w ramach testów została sprawdzona wydajność systemu; zostały również przedstawione wnioski z testów;
* przedstawiono wnioski z pracy oraz możliwości rozwoju systemu.

# Abstract

The purpose of this work is to create a system that collects data from distributed sensors using LoRa (Long Range) technology and stores it in a database for further processing.
The work includes the development of a system that collects data from various sensors, such as thermometers and hygrometers.
The information is collected by proprietary LoRa access points, which then transmit it to a server.
The server stores the data in an InfluxDB 2 database, which is often chosen for IoT (Internet of Things) applications.
In the paper: 
* the technologies, protocols and devices used in the project are described;
* existing solutions, both industrial and scientific, are presented; they are also compared with the solution proposed in the work;
* the design assumptions and detailed implementation of the system are described;
* the process of implementation of the system and the tests carried out were described; as part of the tests, the performance of the system was checked; the conclusions of the tests were also presented;
* conclusions of the work and possibilities for development of the system are presented.

The aim of the work is to develop a system for collecting data from the supplied samples using the LoRa (Long Range) technology and saving them in the data application for primary processing.
As part of the work, a system collecting data from various sensors, such as thermometers and hygrometry, was created.
Information is collected by proprietary LoRa access points, which then transfer it to the server.
A dataset server on the InfluxDB 2 data appliance, which is often chosen for IoT (Internet of Things) applications.
At work:
* technologies, protocols and devices used in operation have been created;
* solutions, both industrial and scientific, have been explored; were also compared with the one introduced in the work;
* project establishment and detailed system implementation;
* the system update process has been checked and tests have been carried out; system performance was checked as part of the tests; test feedback was also used;
* the conclusions from the work and the possibilities of system development were examined.

The purpose of this thesis is to develop a system that collects data from distributed sensors using LoRa (Long Range) technology and stores it in a database for further processing.
The work includes the creation of a system that collects data from various sensors, such as thermometers and hygrometers.
The information is collected by author's own LoRa access points, which then send it to a server.
The server stores the data in an InfluxDB 2 database, which is often chosen for IoT (Internet of Things) applications.
